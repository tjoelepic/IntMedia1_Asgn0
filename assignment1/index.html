        The website I responded to was Palat Tuntaopas's portfolio website.
        <br />
        Found at: https://palat2023.com/
      </p>
      <h3>
        1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing I noticed were the very, very bright, bold, saturated
        colours used and how large the first interactive section was.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <p>My discrete actions were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Move my mouse around in circles in the first section to make the
          colours move around
        </li>
        <li>Read the introduction paragraph in the first section</li>
        <li>Hover over the triangle in the second section a couple times</li>
        <li>
          Spin my mouse around in circles to make the pixels move around in the
          third section
        </li>
        <br />
        <p>Time's up.</p>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I spent the most time in the first brightly coloured section. I really
        enjoyed moving my mouse in circles quickly and then it took me extra
        time to read the paragraph and the 4 different text variations.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>Moving my mouse in circles around the interactive elements.</p>
      <h3>
        5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the intended primary goal was to make something simple and
        focused on showing off some fun, quick interactive elements made in html
        and css with an easy link to contact them at the end.
      </p>
      <h3>
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think that the site communicates this by: not including sidebars or
        menus; not using much text and keeping all text interactive; keeping the
        page short; making each interactive element big.
      </p>
      <h3>
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think that the experience isn't designed to be interacted with for
        very long, probably not more than a couple minutes, and not more than
        once.
      </p>
      <h3>
        8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The page is formatted with each section after another so that as the
        user explores the site they have to scroll past and focus on each
        element to go through the site.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think that the site is fairly abstract and there aren't any obvious
        references. The first section might reference pop art and the painting
        divided into four brightly coloured sections which I think might be from
        Andy Warhol but I'm not confident. I think in the third section the
        typeface might be inspired by 80's hacker tech and the interactive pixel
        grid by CRT televisions.
      </p>
      <h3>
        10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The pop art reference may communicate that their skills in interactive
        design lets them create experiences that can express emotion or
        entertainment like a painting. The element also changes and reveals more
        text layered behind when the user interacts with it, which might show
        how interactivity lets this designer incorporate more compared to
        regular paintings.
      </p>
      <h3>
        11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The bright colours communicate that I should feel positive emotions,
        with the interaction methods of uncovering the different words
        instilling curiousity and desire for exploration.
      </p>
      <h3>
        12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <p>
        There wasn't really any frustrating parts in the site. It was short and
        fairly simple and quick to experience. My most negative emotion while
        looking through the site was trying to make out what the image in the
        pixel grid was but looking at the bright pixels with the small, dark
        gaps between made my head hurt.
      </p>
      <h3>
        13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part was the interactive pixel grid because the
        pixels moved around with really nice arcs and speed tweening. Moving the
        mouse around a lot and then keeping it still so that the pixels would
        slowly move back into place was very appealing.
