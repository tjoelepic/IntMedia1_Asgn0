        The website I responded to was Palat Tuntaopas's portfolio website.
        <br />
        Found at: https://palat2023.com/

      <h3>
        1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing I noticed were the very, very bright, bold, saturated
        colours used and how large the first interactive section was.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <p>My discrete actions were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Move my mouse around in circles in the first section to make the
          colours move around
        </li>
        <li>Read the introduction paragraph in the first section</li>
        <li>Hover over the triangle in the second section a couple times</li>
        <li>
          Spin my mouse around in circles to make the pixels move around in the
          third section
        </li>
        <br />
        <p>Time's up.</p>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I spent the most time in the first brightly coloured section. I really
        enjoyed moving my mouse in circles quickly and then it took me extra
        time to read the paragraph and the 4 different text variations.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>Moving my mouse in circles around the interactive elements.</p>
      <h3>
        5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the intended primary goal was to make something simple and
        focused on showing off some fun, quick interactive elements made in html
        and css with an easy link to contact them at the end.
      </p>
      <h3>
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think that the site communicates this by: not including sidebars or
        menus; not using much text and keeping all text interactive; keeping the
        page short; making each interactive element big.
      </p>
      <h3>
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think that the experience isn't designed to be interacted with for
        very long, probably not more than a couple minutes, and not more than
        once.
      </p>
      <h3>
        8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The page is formatted with each section after another so that as the
        user explores the site they have to scroll past and focus on each
        element to go through the site.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>
        10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>
        11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>
        12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>
        13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
